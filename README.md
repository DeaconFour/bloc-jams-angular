## Bloc Jams - Turn the Music Up!

![](http://www.gtgraves.net/img/angular_album.png)

Bloc Jams is a web based music player built with AngularJS to create a single-page application architecture. This project was built by me with the assistance of my mentor at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/).

There are two different builds of this project.  This build utilizes AngularJS.  A build utilizing basic JavaScript can be found [here](https://github.com/gtgraves/bloc-jams).
